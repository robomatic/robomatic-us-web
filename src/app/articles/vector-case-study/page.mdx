Vector is a space innovator that connects space startups with
affordable and reliable launch vehicles as well as a
software-defined satellites platform (GalacticSky). Its goal is to
eliminate the need to build hardware or even launch a satellite
for customers with certain applications.

## Challenge

The challenge was to design a web application to visualize and
manage GalacticSky resources in a simple, easy-to-use UI. These
resources included the space vehicle (satellite hardware system)
and the compute network and storage infranstructure as well as any
other hardware enabled by the system for management.

## Design + Prototyping

This extremely large undertaking was broken down into smaller
goals; visualization of the spacecraft and its resources,
visualization and monitoring of resource health and performance,
and deploying and managing of software applications on the
virtualized infrastructure.

Visualizing hardware in orbit was important for understanding the
physical location as it relates to communication with ground
systems or other satellites.

Monitoring systems and applications is important for monitoring
and maintaining deployed applications to keep them operational and
efficient.

Easily deploying applications was critical to improving and
enhancing customerâ€™s satellite applications and operations.

The UI evolved based on user feedback and continued research with
subject matter experts. These discussions lead to new designs of
the interface to solve unique customer applications.

## Reflection

The outcome of the design gave form to a new way of looking at
infrastructure management. A small step toward solving UI
challenges in this emerging new-space network frontier.
