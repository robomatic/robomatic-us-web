Skimmer is a web and mobile application SaaS for pool
service businesses. It enables pool businesses to support service
techs in the field of pool cleaning and maintenance and allows them
manage their business with customer invoicing and payments.

## Challenge

The challenge was to design and build an invoicing and payments
feature already in alpha development. This required integrating new design
patterns with existing good patterns while addressing a few poor
design patterns. Working with product management and utilizing user reasearch,
the remainder of the work centered around making sure the feature set
was complete and that the proper user experience was made. Not only was this a huge undertaking, but it
also included a splitting some of my time to help with the total refactor of the front-end using React.

## Design + Prototyping

The existing design was evaluated against the new product
requirements stemming from customer feedback. This encompassed invoicing and
payments and their various configuration defaults and options, invoice management
including how invoices are made, sent and received, and payments
management including entering, updating, deleting and customer
self-payment. This also included customer visibility and
communications of these invoices and payments.

The entire UI feature set, along with all of the dialogs, toasts,
interaction widgets and modals, were mocked up using figma. With
that mockup a functional prototype was created using Figma
documenting the interactions and various user experience implementation notes.

## Reflection

The final design of Skimmer's invoicing and payments not only met Skimmer's
customer needs and expectations but set the tone for improving the
experience and usability of other areas the app. The design and front-end
standardization improvements also served as a focus points for
Skimmer to build a distributed yet cohesive team that was balanced
with world class product, design and engineering practitioners.
