## Challenge

The challenge was to design and build an invoicing and payments
feature already in alpha. This required integrating new design
patterns with existing good patterns while addressing a few poor
design patterns. A lot of the product research had been completed
and much of the work centered around making sure the feature set
was complete and that the proper user experience was design. This
also included addressing a revamp of the front-end using React.

## Design + Prototyping

The existing design was evaluated against the new product
requirements. This encompassed customer settings of invoicing and
payments and their defaults and options, invoice management
including how invoices are made, sent and received, and payments
management including entering, updating, deleting and customer
self-payment. This also included customer visibility and
communications of these invoices and payments.

The entire UI feature set, along with all of the dialogs, toasts,
interaction widgets and modals, were mocked up using figma. With
that mockup a functional prototype was created using Figma
documenting the interactions and user experience notes.

## Reflection

The final design of Skimmer's invoicing and payments now met the
majority of users needs and expectations while improving the
experience and usability of the app. The design and front-end
standardization improvements also served as a focus points for
Skimmer to build a distributed yet cohesive team that was balanced
with world class product, design and engineering practitioners.
