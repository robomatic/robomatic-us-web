For the GalacticSky satellite platform, I handled feature planning, UX/UI design,
and full stack development, creating an intuitive and powerful visualization tool and
satellite-based cloud management solution.
I also designed and developed Vector's modern, responsive CMS marketing website,
showcasing their brand and expertise in the space industry. It featured 3D animations
and interactive launch planning tool for customers to visualize their satellite launches
using Vector's different orbital delivery options.
